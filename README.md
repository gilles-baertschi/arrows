# Arrow programming language

The Arrow language is based on the concept of arrows, as proposed by John Hughes. It focuses on how data flows through the program. This repository contains a compiler for the language. 

The resulting binaries run on Linux. The compilation depends on __nasm__ and on __ld__.

This is a school project.
